                <p>Hello, I'm Jeff. I've been passionate about fitness since my early years, long before hitting puberty. Exercise enables me to excel in the activities I love, like snowboarding, climbing, and mountain biking. I believe in the transformative power of exercise—not just for how it makes you look, but for how it makes you feel and boosts your self-confidence.</p>
                <p>As a NASM certified personal trainer and certified online personal trainer, I offer both in-person training and online consultations. I utilize a combination of weight training, cardio, suspension training, and functional movement exercises to help my clients achieve a physical and functional physique.</p>
                <p>I understand that everyone has different reasons for exercising, so I align my goals with those of my clients. My mission is to educate and empower my clients so they can eventually train independently. My job isn't complete until you're able to take control of your fitness journey and steer towards a lifetime of wellness. I aspire to ignite the same passion for exercise in my clients that I have myself.</p>

        <div class="testimonial-box active">
          <p>"I have been active throughout my entire adult life - lifting weights, running, and swimming regularly on my own. However, when I hit my 40s I noticed that my old routines were not working like they used to. I was starting to feel sluggish, weak, and seemed to be losing muscle mass. I tried CrossFit, but the one-size-fits-all routines and training sessions felt forced and even dangerous at times. Then I started to work with Jeff.</p>
          <p>The past two years as Jeff's client have been terrific; I feel as strong and fit as I did in my 20s. Jeff has customized my fitness plan to match my abilities and needs. He switches up routines regularly in order to help me keep building strength and balance, taking into account my age and experience level. Each routine he develops is loaded into an app that I can access on my phone at the gym when I am working out on my own. Even better, each exercise in the app has an example movement video link embedded in it so that I can quickly and easily ensure I use the proper technique when working out. Jeff is incredibly knowledgeable and provides top-notch customized training that is focused on helping you accomplish your goals, no matter your fitness level."</p>

          <p>I never thought I’d be confident in the gym. It was never my “thing.” Working with Jeff has changed everything I thought about working out and lifting weights; and everything I thought about myself. I was terrified to start. I didn’t think I knew enough and thought I had just let myself go too far. I didn’t see the point. Jeff helped educate me not just about how to do a move, but why. Now, I can’t wait to get to the gym, to test my limits and try new things. I’m doing things I never imagined I was capable of doing. I’ve gained more than strength in the past year. I am not only confident in the gym, I’m more confident in myself. Jeff is amazing to work with. He met me where I was and helped me push my limits. He has been so encouraging and won’t let me give up on myself. I had a few set backs and he helped me get back on track and work through them, staying positive for me when I was anything but. I trust his experience and knowledge and know he is cheering me through every stride I make.</p>

        <p>We started training with Jeff to get stronger and healthier, and the results have far exceeded our expectations. His workouts are challenging but always motivating, and he has a way of pushing us just the right amount to keep us improving without feeling overwhelmed. Our endurance, strength, and overall fitness have noticeably improved, and we feel better than ever. Jeff is knowledgeable, supportive, and genuinely invested in helping his clients succeed. If you’re looking for a trainer who will keep you accountable, make workouts enjoyable, and deliver real results, Jeff is the one.</p>
